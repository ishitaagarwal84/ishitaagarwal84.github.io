I am a poor web developer, as I can't seem to make this work for some reason. But either way - I am trying and hoping that this works out?

Coming to the point -- happy birthday Ishita! God, I can't believe that you're going to turn 24 (I don't think you can believe it either :p) but here we are. You're finally going to be an adult now, going to graduate from college. You'll be managing your own house (Pragya ki madad bhi lena, saara kaam khud mat karna pls), your own meal prep (quinoa aur healthy cheezon ke alawa bhi kuch kuch khaa lena pls), your own finances (Dyson ke baad kuch paise bache toh save bhi kar lena :p). Sounds scary, my God. But although it does, I have full faith in you that you're going to ace it. Given how you are as a person, I am sure that you'll be able to conquer all your fears and crush adulthood as well.

But coming back to you - I hope you don't cry on your birthday this time. At least for my sake because I'm eternally grateful that you saw the light of the day 24 years ago on 8th April. I am very very lucky to have you in my life and I am sure that everyone around you feels the same way - I mean, come on, it is you -- who'd not feel that way? You're an amazing person who brings joy to so many people's lives and I hope you continue to be this way, without changing a bit. People like you are extremely rare and I hope you know that as well. You're one of the kindest, smartest, most empathetic people I know and if you ever doubt that, please come back and read this again because you'd be an idiot if you don't believe it. Given the traits you possess, I am sure you will achieve whatever you decied to set your eyes on. I hope you internalise that because everyone around you knows that it is true. I can go on and on, but there isn't a lot I can say that you haven't heard from me before. I hope you get my gift as well tomorrow.

Meanwhile, here's a small gift from my end as I had to make use of all the photos that I have of you in my phone:

Once again, happy birthday Ishita!
